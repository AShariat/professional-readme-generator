## Description

Since I have started pushing my projects to GitHub I always wanted to follow the same style and flow on my README files that I attach to my projects repositories. I always wanted them to be descriptive and at the same time do not take too much time to be created. This is the biggest reason I have built this app to do the job for me only with answering a few simple questions. This was actually the first node.js app I have built 100% on my own so there were a lots of challenges I had to overcome. I will be using it going forward to create  high quality README files for all of my GitHub repositories and I hope you also find it valuable and useful.

## Installation

First you need to clone this repository then use the terminal inside the root directory of this project to run <npm install> so you get npm packages installed inside app's root directory. Then run index.js by typing <node index.js> inside your terminal and answer all prompts (or skip them by pressing ENTER) until the end. After all prompts are finished you will get a response back from terminal that says Readme Complete!. If you look inside dist directory you will see your generated README.md file ready to be attached to your project's repository.
